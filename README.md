# TrackYoPokemon
Status: In Progress 

##Project Description 
As of 7/17: Learning project using react as the front end of a rails app that tracks your Pokemon Go catches. Just a fun chance to implement react and on page dynamic changes! Still in the progress of adding more features. Check it out live at [https://trackyopokemon.herokuapp.com/](https://trackyopokemon.herokuapp.com/).

I also incorporated search functionality with PokeAPI so you can look up pokemon to add to your catches.
